    <center><h1>An Honorable Shot</h1>
    <p>With the Mongolian Khan pushing your location you stand your ground with your bow strung taunt.</p>
    <p>Sweat drips down your chin as you stand still as a board while the Khan charges at you like a bull.</p>
    <p>As the Khan swings his club the sweat falls and in one smooth motion you fire off a volley of 3 arrows.</p>
    <p>Striking all of the joints between the centimer gaps between his armor plates you manage to defeat him.</p>
    <p>A truely honorable shot for a Samurai of your caliber.</p>
    <h2>You Won</h2>
