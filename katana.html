    <center><h1>The Way of the Blade</h1>
    <p>Harnessing the honor of the Warrior Samurai you draw your Katana and face the masive Khan standing before you.</p>
    <p>The Khan is unwavering and watches you as you stand with an iron pose. He waits for you to make your move.</p>
    <p>With a scream you charge at the Khan; using all the skills you learned as a child of honor.</p>
    <p>The Khan suddenly swings a club at you, laced with poison tips.</p>
    <p>The Khan will fight a dirty battle. How will you fight?</p>
